## üìñ About this Repository

Welcome! This repository serves as a collection of all the exercises, assignments, and projects developed during the **Computational Thinking Using Python** course, which is part of the Systems Analysis and Development (ADS) program at FIAP.

The main goal here is to document my learning journey, apply programming concepts, and build a solid portfolio of my academic work (not to mention try and get used to GitHub in general). Each set of exercises is organized into its own dedicated branch for clarity and version control.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

Throughout this course, I am focusing on developing the following key skills:

-   **Problem Solving:** Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
-   **Algorithmic Thinking:** Designing clear, efficient, step-by-step solutions.
-   **Data Structures:** Understanding and using fundamental structures like lists, dictionaries, and tuples.
-   **Logic and Abstraction:** Applying conditional logic, loops, and functions to create robust code.
-   **Python Fundamentals:** Mastering the syntax, libraries, and best practices of the Python language.
